## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter a security vulnerability in deegree-ogcapi please take care to report the issue in a responsible fashion:

-  Keep exploit details out of the issue report (either report it [here](https://github.com/deegree/deegree-ogcapi/security/advisories/new) or send the report to TMC privately â€“ just like you would do for sensitive sample data)!
-  Be prepared to work with Technical Management Committee (TMC) members on a solution!
-  Keep in mind TMC members are volunteers and an extensive fix may require fundraising and other kinds of contributions!
